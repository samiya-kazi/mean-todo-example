# Mean To-Do Example

## Objective
This is a small MEAN stack application to show basic CRUD operations on an Angular application and Express server. In this application you can create a task, see a list of your tasks, mark a task as done and delete a completed task.


What can you learn from this application:
- Basic CRUD operations on an Express server with a MongoDB database and Mongoose ORM.
- Handling state changes on an Angular frontend for CRUD operations.
- Conditional class rendering in Angular.
- Property binding in Angular.
- Event binding in Angular.


## Getting started
Here are the steps to running the application locally.

Start the server:
1. Open a terminal in the root directory.
2. Move to the server directory ( `cd server` ) and run `npm i` to install server dependencies.
3. Run `node index.js` to start the server. If you have nodemon install globally, you can run `nodemon`.

Start the client:
1. Open another terminal in the root directory.
2. Move to the client directory ( `cd client` ) and run `npm i` to install client dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve --open` to start the application and open it in your browser.
